        About Us
        ========
        We were founded in 1990. At the beginning it was a just flower
        service for special events. Balloons where just an "addition" to the
        main operations. Very soon we have discovered that **balloons make a
        *much* better** material that was almost unutilized. We can dress up an
        event, especially large one, far better on the same budget.

        Balloon decorations can be done in any style, from very conservative
        to super contemporary. With balloons you can **change the visual
        space**, create **focal points**, or **make the room larger or
        smaller**. We can make a sculpture or a huge display in fraction of
        the time of any other decoration would require and *still* stay on
        the budget. The list of benefits is endless!

        Today, almost 20 years later, we are proud to say that we are a
        *balloon* decorating company. Our list of clients is to large to
        display here! Geography of our service is from Virginia Beach to
        Montreal, Canada. And the best of our inventions are still waiting
        for the right client!

         - **We do NOT sell balloons.** An architect, even though he's
        using a lot of bricks, builds castles. We use a lot of balloons, but
        we build "WOW!" for our clients.

         - **We do not have a catalogue.** The idea for our decorational
        service is to invent something new for every event (unless our
        customer likes something in our photo gallery). Our designer meets
        the event coordinator (be it IBM party or a small birthday) on site
        and they discuss possibilities until the client likes the idea.

        Please let us know how we can help make your event a unique and
        unforgettable experience!

        **Some of our Big Name clients** include Coca-Cola and AT&T, SYSCO
        and Staples, the American Heart Foundation and John Hopkins
        University, MCI Center Arena & Gillette Stadium and a long list of
        fund raisers, local schools, colleges, tradeshows and many other
        organizations and individuals for who we created dazzling
        decorations during our 20 years in business.

        We use balloons in our decorations as an architect uses bricks in
        his structures: as an architect will offer you an entire building we
        will offer you a complete decor. So, whether you’re having an
        intimate wedding, a surprise birthday or a colossal corporate
        celebration, we will make occasion an unforgettable experience.

        <h3>So, let us “WOW!” you and your guests with our Balloon
        Designs & Decorations!</h3>
