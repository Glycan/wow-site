        Balloon Walls
        ==============
        The Balloon Wall is simple concept: A wall of balloons with endless
        possibilities. Hang it from the ceiling or give it life and
        portability with helium. Add special effects with blinking lights
        and watch it come alive, a spectacular display in low light
        settings. We’ve even had people dance with Balloon Wall!

        The Balloon Wall does not separate; it celebrates! It unites us!
        Gather family, friends, and colleagues for holidays and special
        occasions. Ask her to marry you. Welcome home a loved one or see
        them off with a bon voyage. Emblazon it with your corporate logo for
        company events. Any occasion that is special to you is all the more
        special with the Balloon Wall.
