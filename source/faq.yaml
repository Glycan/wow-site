        Question of the day: What is your service area?
        ===============================================
        The whole world! However, the setup and delivery fee depends on the
        distance. So if you have a relatively small party, we make sense for
        you if you are within 300 miles from Boston, Montreal or Salt Lake
        City (where we have offices). On the other hand, if you have a large
        event, call us and we will assess whether or not it makes financial
        sense for you or not.

        Friquently Asked Questions
        ==========================

         -  What is your service area?

            The whole world!  However, the setup and delivery fee depends on the distance.  So if you have a relatively small party, we make sense for you if you are within 300 miles from Boston, Montreal or Salt Lake City (where we have offices).  On the other hand, if you have a large event, call us and we will assess whether or not it makes financial sense for you or not.

         -  Can you make _____ out of balloons?

            Since 1990 the answer is "yes"!  It is much faster to say what we don't do: we do not twist animals.  Anything else is possible.

         -  How much is it to decorate a wedding (birthday, anniversary, etc.)?

            There is no answer.  For the same type of occasion some people
            want elaborate sculptures and lighting, while some just want an
            arch at the door.  Once we learn some details about your party,
            and, most importantly,  your taste, we can discuss the
            decorations and the price.

        Please let us know how we can help make your event a unique and unforgettable experience!
