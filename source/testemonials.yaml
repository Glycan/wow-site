        Latest Testimonial
        ==================
        I wanted to thank you again for the wonderful centerpieces that you
        created for us at Arbat on January 29th.  They were beautiful and
        really added so much to our party.  It was a pleasure working with
        you and I will be happy to tell my friends about the great job that
        you did and how wonderfully nice you were.
        Dear Mikhail,

        Sincerely,
        Vikki Avras

        Mikhail,<br/>
        Just a quick note to thank you for the wonderful job you did again
        this year on the birthday party in Newport. The balloons were
        FANTASTIC !! The giant carrots, roots and radishes really helped to
        transport the tent ceiling underground so that the guests truly felt
        as if they had been transported "down the rabbit hole" into Alice’s
        Adventures in Wonderland. The caterpillar tunnel was a huge hit with
        the kids and grownups alike. It was a pleasure working with you and
        we appreciated your coming in on budget and on time. With luck we
        will work together next year on the 4th birthday party, start
        thinking "Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory". <br/>
        Thank you again,<br/>
        Frank Alexander<br/>

        "Michael, Thank you, thank you for your endless creativity. You
        truly Wowed people with your 8 foot balloon that we used as the
        screen to share  a video of us during our wedding. You went way
        beyond our expectations!!! And the bride and the groom were a hit!
        People took so many pictures next to them. We loved working with you
        and are happy to provide references in the future. Keep up the great
        work!!!"<br/>
        Once again thank you so much!<br/>

        "I hired WOW Balloons on two different occasions, both were big
        indoor parties. I was very pleased with Mr. Liberman's services.
        From the initial contact to his final delivery, his manner was
        helpful, professional and creative. The balloon sculptures were
        beautiful, unique, and fun. If you need creative decorations for
        your party, WOW Balloons is the place for you.”

        Hi Mikhail – I’m just getting my head up from the extended  weekend
        and guests.  I can’t thank you enough for the balloon decorations –
        they were fantastic!!  Everyone loved them and, believe it or not,
        the middle ones, too.  I’ll send pix when they come.  A check will
        be in the mail, with a little extra for your help, whom I never got
        a chance to tip.  Again, thank you so much!<br/>

        Dear Mikhail,<br/>
        It was a pleasure to meet you and to work with you on the Goldman
        Event! The rooms looked wonderful both days and the Guests
        continually commented and asked “who did the balloon decorations”!!
        I have given your name to several people over the last 2 days! Good
        Luck and I hope to work with again in the near future.<br/>
        Take Care,<br/>

        Dear Mikhail,<br/>
        You did a great job at my son's Bar Mitzvahs. Everybody loved
        balloon jumping toys and kids couldn't get enough of them. Thank you
        for contributing to the success of our party. Many of our friends
        asked for your name and we were happy to share. Once again, from our
        entire family we thank you for your great job, outstanding
        cooperation and the great results you delivered!<br/>
        Thank you,<br/>
