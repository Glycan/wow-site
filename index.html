Some of our Big Name clients include Coca-Cola and AT&T, SYSCO and Staples, the American Heart Foundation and John Hopkins University, MCI Center Arena & Gillette Stadium and a long list of fund raisers, local schools, colleges, tradeshows and many other organizations and individuals we created dazzling decorations during the 20 years in business.

We use balloons in our decorations as an architect uses bricks in his structures. And as an architect will offer you an entire building we will offer you a complete decor. So, whether youâ€™re having an intimate wedding, a surprise birthday or a colossal corporate celebration, we will make occasion an unforgettable experience.</div>
