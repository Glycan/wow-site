            <h1>Latest Testimonial</h1>
<p>I wanted to thank you again for the wonderful centerpieces that you
created for us at Arbat on January 29th.  They were beautiful and
really added so much to our party.  It was a pleasure working with
you and I will be happy to tell my friends about the great job that
you did and how wonderfully nice you were.
Dear Mikhail,</p>

Mikhail,<br/>
Just a quick note to thank you for the wonderful job you did again
this year on the birthday party in Newport. The balloons were
FANTASTIC !! The giant carrots, roots and radishes really helped to
transport the tent ceiling underground so that the guests truly felt
as if they had been transported "down the rabbit hole" into Alice’s
Adventures in Wonderland. The caterpillar tunnel was a huge hit with
the kids and grownups alike. It was a pleasure working with you and
we appreciated your coming in on budget and on time. With luck we
will work together next year on the 4th birthday party, start
thinking "Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory". <br/>
Thank you again,<br/>
Frank Alexander<br/></p>

"Michael, Thank you, thank you for your endless creativity. You
truly Wowed people with your 8 foot balloon that we used as the
screen to share  a video of us during our wedding. You went way
beyond our expectations!!! And the bride and the groom were a hit!
People took so many pictures next to them. We loved working with you
and are happy to provide references in the future. Keep up the great
work!!!"<br/>
Once again thank you so much!<br/>

"I hired WOW Balloons on two different occasions, both were big
indoor parties. I was very pleased with Mr. Liberman's services.
From the initial contact to his final delivery, his manner was
helpful, professional and creative. The balloon sculptures were
beautiful, unique, and fun. If you need creative decorations for
your party, WOW Balloons is the place for you.”</p>

Hi Mikhail – I’m just getting my head up from the extended  weekend
and guests.  I can’t thank you enough for the balloon decorations –
they were fantastic!!  Everyone loved them and, believe it or not,
the middle ones, too.  I’ll send pix when they come.  A check will
be in the mail, with a little extra for your help, whom I never got
a chance to tip.  Again, thank you so much!<br/>

Dear Mikhail,<br/>
It was a pleasure to meet you and to work with you on the Goldman
Event! The rooms looked wonderful both days and the Guests
continually commented and asked “who did the balloon decorations”!!
I have given your name to several people over the last 2 days! Good
Luck and I hope to work with again in the near future.<br/>
Take Care,<br/>

Dear Mikhail,<br/>
You did a great job at my son's Bar Mitzvahs. Everybody loved
balloon jumping toys and kids couldn't get enough of them. Thank you
for contributing to the success of our party. Many of our friends
asked for your name and we were happy to share. Once again, from our
entire family we thank you for your great job, outstanding
cooperation and the great results you delivered!<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
